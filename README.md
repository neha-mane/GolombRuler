# GolombRuler

Implemented a Golomb Ruler as a part of an assignment for the CSE-537 Artificial Intelligence course

A Golomb Ruler of order M and length L consists of M marks placed at unit intervals (i.e. integer positions) along an imaginary ruler such that the differences in spacing between every pair of marks are all distinct, i.e. no two pairs of marks are the same distance apart. The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest distance between two of its marks is its length.
